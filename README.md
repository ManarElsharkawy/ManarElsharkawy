# Hi there! 👋

### 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm learning programming and building my foundation with **C++**, **problem solving**, and **object-oriented programming**.  
I enjoy understanding how programs work behind the scenes and how logic comes together to create useful applications.

I’ve created a few console projects that helped me practice coding and improve step by step.  
My long-term goal is to become a **Backend .NET Developer**, working with **C#, ASP.NET, APIs, and databases** to build reliable backend systems.

### 🧑‍🏫 What I’m Working On
- Strengthening my logic and fundamentals in **C++**
- Practicing **object-oriented design**
- Learning **Git & GitHub**
- Preparing to switch to the **.NET ecosystem** (C#, ASP.NET Core)
